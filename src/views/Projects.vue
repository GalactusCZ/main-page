          With the help of testers <b>Jouklik</b> and <b>KillerSlovakia</b> and of course <a href="https://fenixprodabing.cz/" target="_blank">FÃ©nix ProDabing</a>, I have worked to get Czech localization into the amazing mod for Return to Castle Wolfenstein, RealRTCW, which aims to modernize the games graphics and restore some of it's parts, that were almost lost to time.

          After quite a lot of time thinking about it, I finally pushed myself to create this webpage. I struggled for a bit figuring out if I should use React, but in the end I settled on <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank">Vue</a> + <a href="https://vite.dev/" target="_blank">Vite</a> with <a href="https://bun.sh/" target="_blank">Bun</a> in the background.
